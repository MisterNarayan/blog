Greetings!

In this world of internet and social accounts, it is impossible to survive without password managers (except if you use same password across all the platforms, but isn't that sound risky?). So if you haven't selected your password manager till now, then [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) would be really handy to work with.

## What is KeePassXC
As mentioned on their website:

> KeePassXC saves your passwords securely. When you double-click a URL in KeePassXC, it launches your default browser to that URL. With browser integration configured, KeePassXC automatically enters username/password credentials into web page fields. 

It's really a nice password manager and easy to use if you are a beginner.

## Why a Password Manager?
Question should be, *Why not to use a password manager?* Because, we all keep creating accounts on all the social and other webstites and remembering them for all the platforms is just not possible. Usernames, are not a big issue, because people can make them consistent across all the sites, but that shouldn't be the case with passwords.

Second, in [this blogpost](https://misternarayan.wordpress.com/2020/05/09/how-to-generate-super-secure-passwords-with-diceware/) I recommended using [Diceware](https://pypi.org/project/diceware/) to create strong, lengthy passphrases for improved security and to remember even 2-3 of such passwords is tedious. Therefore, I would strongly recommend to use [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) or any other password manager of your choice and [Diceware](https://pypi.org/project/diceware/) as your password generator.

## Conclusion
Any password manager you would like to use, will create an encrypted database and to sync your passwords across all your machines you can upload that database file over any cloudhosting platform such as [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) as it is a secure cloud hosting platform and provide file revisions (versioning) or you may go with anyone of your choice.

I have also prepared the following YouTube video to increase the reach of audience: [Managing Passwords with KeePassXC](https://youtu.be/zeRQNY2GSgE)

Alright, that's all for now, thanks for reading!

See you in the next post :)
