Greetings!

Starting a blog is mostly considered with HOW-TOs, detailed descriptions, product reviews, project documentation, monetization, marketing, etc. That means, most of the time people misunderstand the real purpose of blogging.

For all those who would like to know why they should start blogging ASAP, kindly refer to [this resource](https://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blogging.html).

I have been blogging for quite a while. And today, I'm starting one with the [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) and a new one on [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/). My previous blogs were also based on WordPress on different domains, but I'm not willing to shift them anywhere else. Therefore, from now on, I'll be maintaining just these 2 blogs. First is here, where I would be sharing my learning in non-tutorial and comparitivey shorter posts. And the other one is on [MisterNarayan.WordPress.com](https://misternarayan.wordpress.com), where I would be posting tutorials.

That's all for now.

See you in the next post! :)
