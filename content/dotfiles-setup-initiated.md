Greetings!

Recently, I initiated my dotfiles setup. And still, it is not fully furshined. I'll keep updating it as per my requirements and this blog post is here to share the same. My dotfiles are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/misternarayan/dotfiles). Currently (14th May 2020), they are under private repo but soon, I'll make them public.

## What are dotfiles?
These are actally configuration files of your systems, including all your tweaks that you did in your tools, all installed packages details, your specific customizations, etc. So, in case you change your machine or in case of hard-disk failures or in any case when you need to switch to other machine. Now running the installation of your dotfiles setup over the new machine will bring back all your configurations as before. And that's the beauty of having a dotfiles setup.

## Know more about dotfiles
You'll get everything to you need to know about dotfiles here: [Awesome-dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles)

## Conclusion
Switching machine is no more a headache when you have a working dotfiles setup, but make sure to keep updating your dotfiles repo with changes you do locally.

Alright, that's all for now, thanks for reading!

See you in the next post :)
